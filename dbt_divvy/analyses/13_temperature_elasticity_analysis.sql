BUSINESS QUESTION 4A: Temperature Elasticity of Demand by User Type

OBJECTIVE: Analyze how temperature changes affect ridership demand differently for members vs casual riders:
- Temperature sensitivity curves for each user type
- Optimal temperature ranges for maximum casual rider engagement
- Temperature-based conversion opportunity windows
- Seasonal temperature thresholds for campaign activation

MARKETING APPLICATION:
- Temperature-triggered email campaigns (e.g., "Perfect 75째F day for your first membership!")
- Weather-based push notifications for app engagement
- Seasonal membership promotion timing based on temperature comfort zones
- Dynamic pricing strategies during optimal weather windows

EXPECTED INSIGHTS:
- Casual riders are more temperature-sensitive than members
- Optimal temperature range: 65-80째F shows highest casual engagement
- Temperature drops below 50째F reduce casual ridership by 70%+ 
- Members show consistent usage across broader temperature range

EXPECTED INSIGHTS FOR MARKETING:

TEMPERATURE-BASED CAMPAIGN TRIGGERS:
- Perfect Weather (65-80째F): Peak casual engagement - launch premium offers
- Comfort Zone (55-64째F): Moderate engagement - convenience messaging  
- Resilience Weather (45-54째F): Lower engagement - member exclusive benefits
- Extreme Conditions: Specialized messaging for weather-resistant riders

AUTOMATED WEATHER CAMPAIGNS:
- 7-day weather forecast integration for Perfect Weather campaigns
- Real-time temperature triggers for same-day promotional push notifications
- Seasonal temperature trend analysis for annual campaign planning
- Weather-based dynamic pricing and incentive adjustments

CONVERSION OPTIMIZATION:
- Temperature elasticity shows casual riders 3x more weather-sensitive than members
- Optimal conversion window: 65-80째F with 25-40% higher engagement rates
- Weather-resistant casual riders (ride in <50째F) show 85% higher conversion potential
- Hot weather (85째F+) creates opportunity for extended-time membership benefits
