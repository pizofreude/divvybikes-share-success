- **Glue**: Full access for catalog and crawler management
- **IAM**: Create/manage service roles
- **VPC**: Create/manage networking components
- **CloudWatch**: Monitoring and logging

#### **Cost Estimation**
- **Expected Monthly Cost**: $30-50 USD
- **Primary Costs**: Redshift Serverless compute (~$25), S3 storage (~$5), Glue catalog (~$2)
- **Cost Control**: All resources auto-scale to zero when not in use

### **üöÄ Quick Start (15 minutes)**

#### **1. Fork and Clone Repository**
```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub first, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/divvybikes-share-success.git

# 4. Output connection details

# Expected deployment time: 10-15 minutes
```

#### **5. Start Airflow Orchestration**
```bash
# Navigate to Airflow directory
cd ../airflow

# Start Airflow services
./start_airflow.sh

# This will:
# 1. Build Docker containers
# 2. Initialize Airflow database
# 3. Start all services (webserver, scheduler, workers)

# Access Airflow UI: http://localhost:8080
# Default credentials: admin/admin
```

### **üîß Detailed Setup Guide**

#### **Infrastructure Deployment Details**

**Terraform Modules Deployed:**
```bash
# Core Infrastructure
terraform/modules/networking/     # VPC, subnets, security groups
terraform/modules/storage/        # S3 buckets with versioning
terraform/modules/data-warehouse/ # Redshift Serverless configuration
terraform/modules/catalog/        # AWS Glue catalog and crawlers
terraform/modules/security/       # IAM roles and policies

# Environment-specific configurations
terraform/environments/dev/       # Development environment
terraform/environments/staging/   # Staging environment (optional)
terraform/environments/prod/      # Production environment (optional)
```

**Resource Creation Summary:**
- **S3 Buckets**: 3 buckets (Bronze, Silver, Gold) with lifecycle policies
- **Redshift Serverless**: Auto-scaling data warehouse with VPC configuration
- **Glue Catalog**: Data catalog with automatic schema discovery
- **IAM Roles**: Service roles for secure cross-service communication
- **VPC**: Isolated networking with private subnets and NAT gateway

#### **Data Pipeline Setup**

**1. Configure Airflow Connections**
```bash
# Access Airflow UI: http://localhost:8080
# Navigate to Admin > Connections

# Add AWS Connection:
# Connection Id: aws_default
# Connection Type: Amazon Web Services
# Extra: {"region_name": "us-east-1"}

# Add Redshift Connection:
# Connection Id: redshift_default
# Connection Type: Amazon Redshift
# Host: [Your Redshift endpoint from Terraform output]
# Schema: divvy_analytics
# Login: admin
# Password: [Your Redshift password]
```

**2. Set Up Airflow Variables**
```bash
# Run setup script
python airflow/scripts/setup_variables.py

# This configures:
# - S3 bucket names
# - Redshift connection details
# - API endpoints for data sources
# - Processing parameters
```

**3. Configure dbt Profile**
```bash
# Navigate to dbt directory
cd dbt_divvy

# Configure dbt profiles
cp profiles.yml.template ~/.dbt/profiles.yml

# Edit profile with your Redshift credentials
nano ~/.dbt/profiles.yml
```

**dbt Profile Configuration:**
```yaml
divvy_analytics:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: redshift
      host: [your-redshift-endpoint]
      user: admin
      password: [your-password]
      port: 5439
      dbname: divvy_analytics
      schema: analytics
      threads: 4
      keepalives_idle: 240
      ra3_node: true
```

#### **4. Execute Initial Data Pipeline**

**Run Data Ingestion DAGs:**
```bash
# In Airflow UI, enable and trigger these DAGs:
# 1. divvy_data_ingestion - Downloads trip data to S3
# 2. gbfs_data_ingestion - Ingests station data
# 3. weather_data_ingestion - Collects weather data

# Monitor progress in Airflow UI
# Expected runtime: 20-30 minutes for initial load
```

**Execute dbt Transformations:**
```bash
# Navigate to dbt directory
cd dbt_divvy

# Install dbt dependencies
dbt deps

# Run dbt pipeline
dbt run --target dev

# Execute tests
dbt test

# Generate documentation
dbt docs generate
dbt docs serve --port 8081

# Access dbt docs: http://localhost:8081
```

### **üß™ Verification & Testing**

#### **1. Verify Infrastructure**
```bash
# Check AWS resources
aws s3 ls | grep divvy-bikes
aws redshift-serverless list-workgroups
aws glue get-databases

# Verify Terraform state
cd terraform
terraform show
```

#### **2. Verify Data Pipeline**
```bash
# Check S3 data
aws s3 ls s3://your-bronze-bucket/divvy-trips/ --recursive

# Query Redshift
# Connect to Redshift and run:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bronze.divvy_trips;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM silver.trips_cleaned;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM gold.trips_enhanced;
```

#### **3. Verify Analytics Dashboard**
```bash
# Navigate to dashboard directory
cd deploy

# Install R dependencies (if not using containerized deployment)
Rscript -e "install.packages(c('shiny', 'shinydashboard', 'DT', 'plotly', 'leaflet'))"

# Test dashboard locally
Rscript -e "shiny::runApp('app.R', port=3838)"

# Access dashboard: http://localhost:3838
```

### **üìä Dashboard Deployment**

#### **Option 1: shinyapps.io (Recommended)**
```bash
# Install rsconnect
Rscript -e "install.packages('rsconnect')"

# Configure shinyapps.io account
# Get token from https://www.shinyapps.io/admin/#/tokens
Rscript -e "rsconnect::setAccountInfo(name='your-account', token='your-token', secret='your-secret')"

# Deploy dashboard
cd deploy
Rscript deploy.R

# Your dashboard will be available at: https://your-account.shinyapps.io/divvy-bikes-analytics
```

#### **Option 2: Local Docker Deployment**
```bash
# Build and run dashboard container
cd deploy
docker build -t divvy-dashboard .
docker run -p 3838:3838 divvy-dashboard

# Access dashboard: http://localhost:3838
```

### **üîç Troubleshooting Common Issues**

#### **AWS Permission Issues**
```bash
# Error: Access denied to S3/Redshift
# Solution: Verify IAM permissions and region configuration
aws sts get-caller-identity
aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name your-username
```

#### **Terraform Deployment Failures**
```bash
# Error: Resource already exists
# Solution: Import existing resources or destroy/recreate
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bronze your-existing-bucket
# OR
terraform destroy && terraform apply

# Error: Insufficient capacity
# Solution: Try different AWS region or availability zone
```

#### **Airflow Connection Issues**
```bash
# Error: Cannot connect to Redshift
# Solution: Check security group rules and VPC configuration
# Ensure Airflow can reach Redshift on port 5439

# Error: S3 access denied
# Solution: Verify IAM role attachments and S3 bucket policies
```

#### **dbt Execution Issues**
```bash
# Error: Relation does not exist
# Solution: Ensure source tables are created first
dbt run-operation stage_external_sources

# Error: Compilation error
# Solution: Verify model dependencies and SQL syntax
dbt compile
```
